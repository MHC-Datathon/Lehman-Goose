Buses are very important methods of transportation around the city for various groups of people. The ACE program works to improve bus service speeds and consistency by identifying violators blocking bus lanes and bus stops. In order to aid the MTA in improving the efficiency of the ACE program and to fully understand the impact on riders, we have compiled this analysis of the types of violations often found, and the common violators within those vehicles exempt from fines. We have analyzed four bus routes in four boroughs that go near CUNY campuses: M101 (CCNY, Baruch, and Hunter), Bx28 (Lehman), Q44+ (Queens) and B44+ (Brooklyn). In summary we found that emergency vehicles and buses and paratransit vehicles make up the most of the exempt vehicles blocking the lanes, and recommend coordination of bus releases along the routes as well as coordination with emergency departments to create designated spaces for emergency vehicles.
